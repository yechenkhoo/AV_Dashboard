# Autonomous Vehicle Dashboard | Human Computer Interaction
[Sep 2024 - Nov 2024]

## Brief Description
A user-centered dashboard prototype for autonomous vehicles, designed to improve safety, navigation, and user trust by integrating real-time updates, vehicle health monitoring, and adaptive driving assistance.

## Contributions
Contributed to the design and implementation of the dashboard across multiple project phases, from needfinding to prototyping and evaluation.

Designed and developed the Vehicle Health Page, providing real-time indicators such as battery, engine, cooler, and automation system status.

Improved the visual layout and usability of the Vehicle Health interface, centering key components for better clarity and aligning with EV-specific design.

Collaborated on usability evaluations and report writing, refining the system based on heuristic and think-aloud testing results.

## Lessons Learnt
Strengthened understanding of Human-Computer Interaction principles, particularly user-centered design and heuristic evaluation.

Learned to balance information density and clarity to avoid overwhelming users while ensuring safety-critical updates are visible.

Gained practical experience with low- and high-fidelity prototyping, iterative design, and teamwork in a multidisciplinary setting.

Enhanced ability to translate user research into functional interface designs for real-world applications.
